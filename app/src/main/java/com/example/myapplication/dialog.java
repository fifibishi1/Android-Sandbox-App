Customer acknowledges and agrees that any breach of its obligations with respect to Vendor’s Confidential Information and intellectual property rights may cause substantial harm to Vendor, which could not be remedied by payment of damages alone. Accordingly, Customer hereby agrees that Vendor will be entitled to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in any jurisdiction where damage may occur without a requirement to post a bond, in addition to all other remedies available to it for any such breach. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remaining provisions will, nevertheless, remain in full force and effect, and such provision will be reformed in a manner to effectuate the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible and remain enforceable. If such reformation is not possible in a manner that is enforceable, then such term will be severed from the remaining terms, and the remaining terms will remain in effect. This Agreement is not assignable by Customer except with Vendor’s prior written consent. A change of control of Customer (whether by merger, sale of equity, operation of law, or otherwise) shall be deemed an assignment requiring Vendor’s prior written consent. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be void and of no force or effect. Vendor may transfer and assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without Customer’s consent. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their successors, and permitted assigns. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the Parties and supersedes all previous written and oral agreements, communications, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. All waivers, amendments, and modifications of this Agreement must be in a writing signed by authorized representatives of each Party. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and Customer does not have any authority of any kind to bind Vendor in any respect whatsoever. All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. The titles and section headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only and shall not be used in the interpretation or construction of this Agreement. No rule of construction resolving any ambiguity in favor of the non-drafting Party shall be applied hereto. The word “including”, when used herein, is illustrative rather than exclusive and means “including, without limitation.” This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of California with regard to the resolution of any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. The application of the UN Convention of International Sale of Goods to this Agreement is disclaimed in its entirety. This Agreement may be executed in two counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and which together will constitute one instrument.\n" +
